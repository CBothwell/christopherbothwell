    <h2 class='text-2xl font-medium'>Privacy Policy:</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called ‘cookies’ (see explanation below) and server logs to collect information about how our site is used. Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our site, and the websites visited just before and just after our own, as well as your IP address.

      <h3 class='text-xl font-medium'>Use of Cookies:</h3>
      <p>
        A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

      <h3 class='text-xl font-medium'>IP Addresses:</h3>
      <p>
    IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. An IP address is an identifier which a web server will use to help it know where to sent the information you requested. IP addresses are automatically collected by the web server.
